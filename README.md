# Moisture Sensor Display Server.
---

This repository contains code for a simple flask app (single-page) which displays an updating graph of moisture sensor readings
for the raspberry pi.

To install dependencies,  clone into `home/pi/moisture-sensor-display-server` and run:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This should take a while, but eventually the pi will restart in kiosk mode.
